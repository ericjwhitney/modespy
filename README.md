# MODESpy

**MODESpy** implements generic methods for constructing and using
parameterised linear multi-step methods to solve Ordinary Differential
Equation Initial Value Problems (ODE IVPs). It is a Python implementation
based on the MODES toolbox (Version 1.0.0) written in MATLAB from Lund
University (refer to **[documentation](https://modespy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**
 for details). 

The current version is **0.9.0**.

## Installation

MODESpy relies on the installation of NumPy, 
**[see this link](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)**.

Install MODESpy using the typical pip installation methods, for example:
- Using a shell with pip directly and root access:
```console
$ pip install modespy
```
- Using a windows prompt as a user only: 
```console
C:\> py -m pip install --user modespy
```
